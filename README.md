# WeatherApp
There was a beautiful idea of building an app that would show the upcoming weather. My team wrote a nice backend and a frontend following the latest principles.
Use everything weâ€™ve been discussing to create a weather forecast site using the weather API from the previous lesson. You should be able to search for a specific 
location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

Technoligies Used:-
1. Kotlin Language
2. API and Retrofit
3. MVVM
4. Mockito and JUnit Testing 
5. Google Firebase Crashlytics
6. RoomDB for Syorage
